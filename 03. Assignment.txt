Meta tags are important because they impact how your site appears in the SERPs.
More people will be inclined to click through to your website. 
They will therefore impact your traffic and engagement rates, which can impact your SEO and rankings.
Meta tags are an important part of a solid SEO strategy.
Meta tags are snippets of code that tell search engines important information about your web page, such as how they should display it in search results. 
They also tell web browsers how to display it to visitors. 
Every web page has meta tags, but they're only visible in the HTML code.
