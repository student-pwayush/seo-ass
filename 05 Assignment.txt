A **favicon**, short for "favorite icon," is a small icon or image associated with a website or webpage. It is typically displayed in the browser's address bar, tabs, bookmarks, and when a user saves a webpage as a bookmark or favorite. Favicon images are usually square and very small in size, often measured in pixels, such as 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels.

Illustrative example:

Let's say you have a website for a bookstore called "BookWorms." To create a favicon for your website, you design a tiny book icon to represent your bookstore.

It's a subtle yet important element of web design that contributes to a website's overall visual identity and user experience.
